				<p> Dear Mom, <br><br> I hope you find this website cute! It's the <span class="highlight"> first one </span>I've built that I would actually show anyone! It was a lot easier to make than any website I've tried to build in the past because I was making it for you. <br><br> Thank you for always giving me all of the things I've needed to get where I am in life. You've given me <span class="highlight">courage</span> to do some crazy things like move 3000 miles away from everyone and everything I know. You've given me <span class="highlight"> love </span>   so that I know wherever I go, whatever I do, I have someone cheering for me unconditionally. You've given me <span class="highlight">happiness </span> - you've always been my role model: you take life day by day, see beauty in everything, you're kind, generous, thoughtful, and you are in tune with yourself. <span class="highlight">You're always who I've wanted to be like when I grew up!</span> I think I am finally getting there, and it's thanks to the wings you've given me. I love you so much. <br><br><br> <span class="highlight">Happy Mother's Day!</span></p>
